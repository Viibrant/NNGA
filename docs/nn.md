## 1. Introduction

The Iris dataset is a classic machine learning classification problem, introduced in 1936 by Ronald A.
Fisher. This report aims to create an artificial neural network to accurately classify Iris plants into
three species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica. We tackle the challenge of non-linear
separability between two species through data preprocessing, neural network design, optimization,validation,
and evaluation. Our goal is to provide insights and pave the way for future research in this field.

## 2. Data Analysis and Pre-processing

In the Data Analysis and Pre-processing section, we start by loading and examining the Iris dataset(Wu et al., 2019).
We handle missing values, perform feature scaling, and convert categorical features into numerical representations.
Data visualization techniques are employed to identify patterns and trends that inform our neural network architecture
design and training strategy. This stage lays the groundwork for an effective machine learning model.

- Data loading and exploration
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling and encoding
- Data visualization

## 3. Dataset Representation and Normalization

In the Dataset Representation and Normalization section, we focus on representing input and output data effectively,
normalizing and standardizing features to ensure consistent scales (Laurent et al., 2015), and optionally employing
dimensionality reduction techniques to improve model performance and computational efficiency. This stage is crucial
for training a reliable and accurate neural network .

- Input and output representation
- Data normalization and standardization
- Optional: Dimensionality reduction techniques

## 4. Splitting the Dataset

- Split-sample training (train, validation, and test sets)
- K-fold cross-validation

## 5.Neural Network Design and Architecture

In this section, we focus on the neural network design and architecture for the Iris dataset classification. We will
discuss network topology, including layers, neurons, and activation functions. Additionally, we will explore training
parameters, such as learning rate, momentum, and weight initialization. We will outline the chosen training method,
backpropagation (Hecht-Nielsen, 1992) with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, and discuss strategies for determining
the optimal number of hidden neurons to balance model complexity and performance.

## 6. Training the Neural Network

In this section, we delve into the essential aspects of training the neural network for the Iris dataset classification.
We will cover the selection of an appropriate training algorithm and define stopping conditions that ensure the convergence
of the learning process (Barnard, 1992). Additionally, we will discuss the training procedures for both split-sample and
cross-validation methods, comparing their advantages and disadvantages while highlighting their importance in optimizing
the model's performance and generalization capabilities.

## 8. Experimentation and Analysis

- Experimenting with various neural network parameters
- Comparing model performance and error analysis
- Interpreting feature importance and model limitations

## 9. Conclusion
