## 1. Introduction

In the realm of machine learning and pattern recognition, the Iris dataset has established itself as an iconic and fundamental classification problem. Introduced by British statistician and biologist Ronald A. Fisher in 1936 (Feng, 2021), the dataset has since provided a challenging and educational testbed for researchers and students alike. The primary objective of this report is to develop, train, validate, and test an artificial neural network capable of accurately classifying Iris plants into three distinct species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica.

With a total of 150 instances in the dataset, each Iris plant is characterized by four continuous attributes measured in centimeters: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The complexity of this classification problem arises from the fact that while Iris Setosa is linearly separable from the other two species, Iris Versicolour and Iris Virginica are not linearly separable from one another (Feng, 2021).

To address this challenge, we embark on a systematic approach that encompasses data preprocessing, neural network architecture design, training algorithm optimization, model validation, and performance evaluation. By creating an efficient and accurate neural network, we aim to contribute valuable insights into the Iris classification problem and pave the way for future research and exploration in this fascinating area.

## 2. Data Analysis and Pre-processing

In the Data Analysis and Pre-processing section, we start by loading and examining the Iris dataset. We handle missing values, perform feature scaling, and convert categorical features into numerical representations. Data visualization techniques are employed to identify patterns and trends that inform our neural network architecture design and training strategy. This stage lays the groundwork for an effective machine learning model.

- Data loading and exploration
- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling and encoding
- Data visualization

## 3. Dataset Representation and Normalization

In the Dataset Representation and Normalization section, we focus on representing input and output data effectively, normalizing and standardizing features to ensure consistent scales, and optionally employing dimensionality reduction techniques to improve model performance and computational efficiency. This stage is crucial for training a reliable and accurate neural network.

- Input and output representation
- Data normalization and standardization
- Optional: Dimensionality reduction techniques

## 4. Splitting the Dataset

- Split-sample training (train, validation, and test sets)
- K-fold cross-validation

## 5.Neural Network Design and Architecture

In this section, we focus on the neural network design and architecture for the Iris dataset classification. We will discuss network topology, including layers, neurons, and activation functions. Additionally, we will explore training parameters, such as learning rate, momentum, and weight initialization. We will outline the chosen training method, backpropagation (Hecht-Nielsen, 1992) with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, and discuss strategies for determining the optimal number of hidden neurons to balance model complexity and performance.
