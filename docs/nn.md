## Abstract

In this paper, we explore two different optimization problems: a neural network for the Iris dataset and a genetic algorithm for the SHUBERT function. We design, implement, and evaluate both optimization techniques, comparing their performance and discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each method. The artificial neural network is employed to classify iris flowers based on their morphological features, while the genetic algorithm is utilized to optimize the SHUBERT function, a well-known benchmark problem in the global optimization domain. By comparing the results of these two distinct optimization approaches, we provide insights into their applicability and effectiveness in solving different types of problems.

## 1 Introduction

In recent years, optimizations techniques have gained significant attention due to their wide range of applications in various fields such as machine learning, engineering, and finance. Among these techniques, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and genetic algorithms (GAs) have emerged as powerful tools for solving complex problems. This paper explores the application of ANNs to classify the Iris dataset, a well-known benchmark problem in machine learning, and the use of GAs to optimize the SHUBERT function, a challenging global optimization problem. By comparing the performance of these two distinct optimization methods, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of their strengths and weaknesses, as well as their suitability for different types of problems. This paper will cover the design, implementation, evaluation, and comparison of ANNs and GAs in the context of the Iris dataset classification and SHUBERT function optimization.

## 2.1 Introduction To Problem 

The ability to automatically classify plants based on their physical attributes would massively benefit agricultural research. Manual identification of plant types can be a tedious task, especially when dealing with large datasets. Machine learning techniques, specifically neural networks, have been successful in automating classification processes.

A popular dataset used for classification problems is the Iris dataset. The iris dataset contains measurements of 150 flowers, all categorised via 4 attributes: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. Using these attributes we can classify the flowers into three different species: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica.

Sepals and petals are virtual features that are ideal to identify species of iris flowers. Sepals are the outer casing of the flower in early development. Petals, on the other hand, are the bright outer parts of the flower used to attract pollinators. The lengths and widths of these structures vary between the species of iris flowers, making them ideal for classification.

Within this section of this report we will use the iris dataset to build a neural network that can accurately classify each sample based in its attribute measurements. Doing so will require analysis and processing the iris dataset along with designing, building and training a neural network.
